## SAT_JSh

A tool based on the ZCAM for a more perceptually uniform increase or decrease in image saturation.

INPUT：Linear、CIE XYZ D65. Please using Color Space Transform, Tone mapping method:None, Gamut Mapping method:None.

Luminance Adjust：Adjusting the model's prediction of luminance. Saturation Suppression is used to change the saturation weight of the image, similar to Color Boost,where higher values make the original highly saturated areas less likely to receive the image.
